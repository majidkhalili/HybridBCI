1691	And lots of information can be gleaned from the United Nation’s own web site, and all the organizations that are under it, this umbrella of organizations, non-governmental organizations and so on.
1692	And lots of retired bureaucrats are given extra cash to take early retirement and settle amongst you lot, the people, and live next door and so on.
1693	And lots would never do that because of the kind of money they get paid for it.
1694	And many countries have tried since then.
1695	And many things have come out of that writing, to do with that.
1696	And Milner himself came up with that term, by the way, Commonwealth of Nations.
1697	And my job is not to give them an answer.
1698	And new opportunities are constantly materializing, beginning with transparency and participation (e-democracy) as well as open data systems.
1699	And no, it’s no 1000 t up to political parties to deny any industry’s existence.
1700	And no it's not because am British etc I would say the same thing for a Japanese ship or german.
1701	And no, it’s not u 1000 p to political parties to deny any industry’s existence.
1702	And no one asks how come government is forcing this down everyone’s throats.
1703	And not a few think-tanks are deliberating quite in depth on it.
1704	And not by preparing random lists of works translated and of scholars classified by the confessional pedigree.
1705	And nothing has had a more profound impact on the development of modern civilization.
1706	And not just any old fire sale either.
1707	And not least, TA can stimulate public debate as a means for the democratization about technological choices.
1708	And not only that, by the way, these guys don't see you any different from the African or the Chinese, the peasant to these boys at the top is the peasant worldwide.
1709	And now, in a shocking and grimly symbolic development, the Russians and Georgians have used their respective ‘peacekeeping’ contingents to wage open warfare!
1710	And now of course you do not need to connect this to Roma only.
1711	And now, O Lord, this man of God, Who breaks the bread of life this morning -- Shadow him in the hollow of thy hand, And keep him out of the gunshot of the devil.
1712	And now there’s sort of this righteous anger that’s brewed up, first in the Middle East, in various parts of Europe, and now it’s hitting home in America.
1713	And now they’ll never pay anything back.
1714	And now you say you have to think for your interests and why should the taxpayers pay for the south.
1715	And obviously, the same applies to relational terms such as ‘duties’ and ‘obligations’.
1716	And, of course, all passed through the ethics and deontological point of view.
1717	And of course having access to great networks and finding the right partners and investors.
1718	And of course, I think that Britain was awfully glad that Argentina tried to make a grab for it, and they could reestablish there, because someone stuck a flag in it once, apparently, and that was it.
1719	And of course that’s the idea of it.
1720	And of course, the computer is only one step towards it, to get us used to it.
1721	And of course, the new system, of course, there’s no right and wrong; there’s no good or evil.
1722	And of course they could have lots of sex, later in life, they found, but they couldn’t bond for any length of time with any person.

1724	And of hard work from European nations and European institutions ever since.
1725	And, once we are officially recognized as a distinct community, what should our goals be?
1726	And once you’re caught on it you want to know what the next series, what’s going to happen, will they live, will they survive..
1727	And one day it will be your turn to be laughed at as well.
1728	And one of them is called:) The Discriminating Irritant Projectile (Dip) (A: D-I-P.

1730	And only if every nation will work on its weaknesses will the European Union be able to pool its members’ strengths for greater impact on the global stage.
1731	And only very late in the day was it acknowledged that the overwhelming majority of victims, both Jewish and non-Jewish, were from Central and Eastern Europe.
1732	And on top of everything, I thought that the relatively positive reaction of the Parliament referred to the Commission proposal - now I read that it seems to be the reaction to the Council compromise proposal.
1733	And our impact is growing by the day.
1734	And over the last few weeks, heat has swirled around Ricardo de Montreuil's "The Raven," about a man pursued across a dystopian downtown Los Angeles, where the film was shot.
1735	And people have long found acceptable ways to live together in their local communities in everyday life of the immigration society – with mutual acceptance and few conflicts.

1739	And probably will be known for being the most efficient country in gaining funds from Horizon 2020 (H2020).
1740	And proof is this type of propaganda pushing for tolerance of the intolerant.
1741	András Szöllösi-Nagy: We have the largest education institute on water in the world, a graduate school in Delft “IHE”, which serves entirely the needs of the developing world.

1744	Andrea says that her well-balanced socialisation as a child, enabled her to have a different world-view, one where women were valued, and rightfully so.
1745	Andreas has brought this experience to bear within ACGT, pushing the consortium to always take into account the true needs of the stakeholders and to develop solutions that make sense in actual environments rather than purely research contexts.
1746	Andreas Hensel is president of the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) was set up on 1 November 2002 as part of the Federal Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection (BMELV).

1748	Andreev, Project Manager WiSDOM.
1749	And remember Carroll Quigley talked about the new feudal system run by CEOs of corporations.
1750	And remember too, in ancient times as well, this same people, blood sacrifice was their highest thing; the taking of blood and blood ritual sacrifice was a key part of their particular religion, and sacrifice too.
1751	And remember too, that you are the folks who bring me to you.
1752	And remember too, that you're the audience that bring me to you.
1753	Andrew MichtaProfessor of international studies at Rhodes College and senior fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis The EU is in very real danger of losing at least one of its neighborhoods.
1754	Andrew R. Wilson is Professor of Strategy and Policy at the United States Naval War College in Newport, RI.
1755	Android quickly gained popularity among smartphone developers and continues to evolve further from a platform for smartphones to a platform for netbooks, tablets and also to be integrated into home appliances.
1756	And Russell goes into this kind of thing, and he’s all for it of course, because he doesn’t like the wage-earner type.
1757	And secondly, we have an international treaty, called the protocol to eliminate illicit trade by the World Health Organisation.
1758	And she is not the only star who has suffered from this disease.
1759	And simply not produce imprisoned.
1760	And since no one dared to outsmart them, everyone lived unhappily ever after.
1761	And since the same decision was taken also for Germany, Prime Minister Boyko Borissov hastened to comment on how the news, that we were in the same group with Germany, echoed around the world.
1762	And, since the whole carbon credit nonsense was dreamed up by crooks, to start with, who deal with high finance and so on, but definitely crooks, with the whole idea to fleece the planet, of making you pay for breathing and all the rest of it.
1763	And Snyder can fire elected officials unilaterally, without any input from voters.
1764	And so are accompanied the ‘old persons’ who live at the Domaine: free, citizens, with dignity, respected and standing tall… until the end.
1765	And so, I got into the books early, into the United Nations, traced the history of the League of Nations, and read many books by the players and those who spoke at the United Nations, and I caught on.
1766	And so I hesitate.
1767	And some of the biggest problems with which our societies are confronted are I believe the fragmentation of knowledge, the lack of memory and the lack of time to think.
1768	And some people had these fibers growing out of their systems.
1769	And something has to be done, they always have the cry going out, something must be done, and they go ahead and do it.
1770	And so my message here is: Count on the European Union to build this new start.
1771	And so once they set the precedent there, they expand it.
1772	And so there is little chance of this reform being realised either.
1773	And so, these characters want to inhabit the physical realm, because, for some reason or other, they’re basically trapped within this realm.
1774	And so the young children are already being raised up with a whole new curriculum, a very vague history, where there’s no conflict at all, and they’re all just one big, happy family.
1775	And so with that cleared up there is another topic, a more important one but it got a lot less coverage and it needs an answer.
1776	And speaking of Disneyland, you know that Genesis broadcasting that gives us all our heroes, you know, they’re owned by the ABN News, ABN Station, or ABC?
1777	And support is awsome.
1778	And surely the reason why pleasure dpf not the criterion to which we should look in making these decisions is that it is not the yaesu ft-857d manual pdf.
1779	And that follows along your line of thinking, you know, and everything.
1780	And that goes for your money system, and every other system there is, because psychopaths, once they get in, they can cause so much damage so quickly.
1781	And that had to be destroyed as well to bring in this great society, this global society that he talks about where you are in flux, you have no anchor basically, because you can’t relate to a global world society.
1782	And that is a fact, study after study has proven that.
1783	And that is why they're driving so quickly now to pull this off as we adapt to change, and there's no normalcy left in any sphere to compare with.
1784	And that means YOU putting the apron of a carpenter, the gloves of a metal welder, and be proud that you are able to do so… I said enough…Again…!
1785	And that’s again the feeling of history here.
1786	And that's all quite legal.
1787	And that’s all you had to know; that was it, very, very simple.
1788	And that’s always true.
1789	And that’s as cold-blooded as that.
1790	And that’s been awfully well accomplished as well.
1791	And that's coming here too.
1792	And that seems to be your main concern.
1793	And that’s exactly what happens through treaties, etc.
1794	And thats how racism tends are created.
1795	And that’s how the big boys can get away with it too.
1796	And that’s how this simple trick of creating this big system works.
1797	And that’s kind of weak, but that’s the only power we have.
1798	And that’s not coincidence either because those who ran East Germany are running the States and Britain, and a lot of other countries, and it won’t be who you think either.
1799	And that’s not imposing anything on Member States, that’s what Member States agreed to when they joined the EU.
1800	And that’s not normal.
1801	And that's really how the society is still based today on this.
1802	And that’s really what it’s doing.
1803	And that’s the only way you stop these bar stewards from doing these things, is just saying no.
1804	And that’s what it’s meant to do, strike terror into everyone.) Tom Clarke was horrified when he mis-kicked the ball and it looped over a garden fence and smashed a greenhouse window pane.
1805	And that’s what they keep saying in all of their memos and dictates that they give to the public, governance is the term they use.
1806	And that’s why they pay characters to be on the media, mainstream, big characters, the famous name ones, who, they keep them there until they’re dropping off the chair in their 80s, because you’ve grown up with them, and daddy would never lie to you.
1807	And that's why they're on a roll now.
1808	And that’s why you have such incredibly expensive healthcare for instance today.
1809	And that's why you must be altered, and monitored and watched twenty-four hours a day.
1810	And that’s why you’re so easily run and you vote all the time for the same one system.
1811	And that’s why you’re tried by a jury of your peers.
1812	And that's why you've got all these different comedies out there, supposedly, on particular proclivities towards sexual relations.
1813	And that took well over a hundred years you know.
1814	And that was part of their goal: destroy the family and destroy the natural community.
1815	And that what they also intend is to reduce the awkward and diverse legal debate to nothing, a debate about which I am sure we will hear a lot in the coming days.
1816	And that would have been probably some time back in ’93 or ’94 or somewhere around there, when I was a C-SPAN junkie.
1817	And the big boys mean business, otherwise they lose it all.
1818	And the bigger picture is that TTIP has not only an economic but also a powerful geopolitical dimension.
1819	And the companies that are the drivers of growth and employment in Europe are really stepping up.
1820	And the fact is, there’s stacks of oil out there, and I’ve got an old children’s schoolbook here, I got at a yard sale, and it was about all the oil fields that had been found in the 1920s.
1821	And the good citizen, the one who has done nothing wrong, will have nothing to worry about.
1822	And the guy who wrote the book, what was it called, Alan?
1823	And the health inequalities will probably become even more obvious, not only between the Member States, but also within them.
1824	And the IBM also has one here, A Smarter Planet for a Sustainable Future, a talk he gave at the summit at START.
1825	And the Iconoclast Series wasn't sort of bad to listen to, because it's the usual BBC format, the pros and cons.
1826	And the inoculations and all the rest of it were all part of that.
1827	And the interesting thing here and the reason why I put this in Italics and blue is the Numerical Reasoning because it’s scored on a scale of 0-10 and there’s only a pass mark.
1828	And the international statistics.
1829	And the master knows he's the master, the guards know they're the guards, and the slaves know they're the slaves.
1830	And the memory of supposedly what was done before to them in a previous time, when they were hunted and persecuted after they tried to do something in ancient times to take over the ancient world.
1831	And the most important thing about it was the debates.
1832	And the "national interest" always works in the same way.
1833	"…and the Nazis' attempt to use eugenic justifications for the Holocaust at the Nuremberg Trials.
1834	And then I got to wondering, would there be any edits made since that book first came out.
1835	And then it becomes clear that with the iconic we can show things that we could never express with words (the opposite is obviously just as true).
1836	And then suddenly they're dancing apart, staring at each other's knees.
1837	And then the Americans are in there.
1838	And then the plundering of the world’s resources, the same stuff that came out from the Milner Group that became the Royal Institute of International Affairs a long time ago, or the Council on Foreign Relations in America.
1839	And then there’s another one, it’s actually from The Star, the newspaper, The Star.
1840	And then there was 2008.
1841	And then the sense of achievement and power he gets from gaining so much wealth over the years, kind of has turned into a bit of a fatal combination.
1842	And then they blame you, that it’s your fault, when they’re causing it with geoengineering.
1843	And then they'd plug whatever they're selling at the end of it as the cure all.
1844	And then they grab your savings.
1845	And then they hit upon environmental sustainability and architecture, and they gave it to this dumbo.
1846	And then they jack all the rates up and then when you complain about certain things or you can’t get something fixed, you can’t complain to government anymore.
1847	And then they put it back in the water.
1848	And then they stack the audience with their own people.
1849	And then we take the wrong measures because we think the solution has to move one of those metrics and numbers in the right direction.
1850	And then you either get drunk or party or get stoned, a lot of people get stoned.
1851	And then you go back two or three years, and you find the head of the Green Party.
1852	And then you go into Canada.
1853	And the ones at the top just smile at each other, have a good laugh and keep quiet about it.
1854	And the one that they hit upon was Global Warming.
1855	And the only right you have..
1856	And the Pentagon too.
1857	And the police had turned him down before because they had visited his apartment in Scotland.
1858	And the political struggle will be radically different if, for example, you are not allowed to do whatever you want in the fiscal area.
1859	And there is also the thing that the ships only use their optical fire control systems and in that regard the IJN and KM was the best.
1860	And there is another point: in Baden-Württemberg there are seed-growing regions, and here too there will be serious problems if the Western corn rootworm makes an appearance.
1861	And the representatives of Daugavpils are looking forward to many new ideas to take home from the PLACES conference.
1862	And there’s also Alex hanging on from BC.
1863	And there’s an article out too, it’s called..
1864	And there's a patient looking up at him as though she's looking up at a statue of the local god.
1865	And there’s dozens and dozens of movies out right now, and coming out, all on the same agenda with massive police states.
1866	And there’s no real shock once we’re totally amalgamated.
1867	And, there’s not a whole lot that can be said.
1868	And there’s nothing better than to get the people to demand that it changes.
1869	And there they are, just slobbering across the sky leaving trail after trail that’s one massive misty mush and the end of it all.
1870	And there was a debate about medicalisation, or inventing diseases, as if we did not have enough health challenges.
1871	And there was one still in Hong Kong I think in the Pavilion, the old pavilion that’s there, that’s a remnant of the old East India company too; they had headquarters there.
1872	And there will be no need for ploughing.
1873	And the same idea, politicians, and the same agenda goes forward.
1874	And the same the European elites did to the Africans in order to justify slave labor…You are doing what the Nazis and the Puritans were doing.
1875	And the same thing’s to happen to the Americas.
1876	And the schmucks put it all up there anyway, don't they?
1877	And these are all laws that are put into effect, you know.
1878	And the second thing is financial stability because our neighbours Greece showed us that if this pillar is violated imbalances happen which are then very, very hard to overcome.
1879	And these folks mostly talk crap.
1880	And these machines are not exactly new.
1881	And the World Trade Organization too is the organization they used to sign agreements to transfer all of the construction and factories and so on across to China – quite a few years ago now, but the general public weren’t even told it was going on.
1882	And they all carry transcripts in English for print-up, as well, of many of the talks I’ve given.
1883	And they also came to an understanding on both sides of the trenches, because even the Germans were putting older guys in too, and they were too mature.
1884	And they always get what they want.) It has not announced how it will determine its post-2020 target, nor when it will make it public.
1885	And they boasted about bringing in the New Age of Aquarius, with all of the old stuff, you know, the horoscopes, and the tarot cards, and all the symbology and so on.
1886	And they can also adopt certain ones into their families, as the Rothschilds have done as well.
1887	And they can spend their whole lives in there.
1888	" And they can't run."
1889	And they collect all this stuff but very few of them actually ever figure out, why can’t you get real anything anymore, even real wood, for instance.
1890	And they’d borrow money from all the moneylenders to fight these wars, mind you the taxpayer paid it all back, and it was a fantastic deal for the bankers.
1891	And they'd have to give a lot of propaganda to the public too, about too many people, the need to cut back on the wrong types of people who are breeding, and also to sterilize them in some way without them even knowing.
1892	And they do it.
1893	And they even tell you why he did this; he was feeling down that day, blah, blah, blah.
1894	And they feel nothing for anything that they do.
1895	And they give us the appearance of it, don't they, as they kiss babies at election time, and say all the right things that you expect them to say.
1896	And they got to believe what they’re doing.
1897	And they have been building up internal armies to do this very thing for years.
1898	And they have no idea, none at all what's really, really going on.
1899	And they have no idea what the guy had.
1900	And they have no mercy whatsoever.
1901	And they have their own goals, of course, that don’t really include the general public.
1902	And they hired a lot of fronts to do their talking for them.
1903	And they just, if you try to talk to full grown adults they're mental midgets.
1904	And they’ll be surprised what they come up with.
1905	And they may not agree with you now, the children especially, because they're getting a totally different indoctrination at school, and they're getting all their values from the state as Huxley and others said would happen, that was always the agenda.
1906	And they met last year: On March 10, 2011, forty Pacific Council members visited the Simi Valley campus of AeroVironment, Inc.
1907	And they ray ban erika erased any doubts by flashing a handful of gemstones or a photo of the Bahia Emerald.
1908	And they really are like that folks.
1909	And they really mean it, too.
1910	And they’re also speculating in the stock market too, all the time, remember.
1911	And they’re bringing in a hell on earth, and you don’t know it, because you’re getting used to it already.
1912	And they're going after people's stoves in Britain, if you heat by a certain particular oil type stove, it heats the house and you can cook on it too.
1913	And they're going to reinforce the idea that it was a legitimate attack and so forth.
1914	And they respect the workers for their hard work.
1915	And they’re talking about the cost now of the turnover of keeping a patient, treating patients, etc, etc.
1916	And they’re telling you that the people are not wanted anymore.
1917	And they’re told pat answers and that satisfies the parents.
1918	And they said, it’s for the earth, and we’re going to pay it to a foreign company.
1919	And they said, "Well sir, it's the gladiators and slaves.
1920	And they say, there's nothing you can do.
1921	And they should be!
1922	And they showed you the train station with the cages with all the immigrants in it and you know the dogs and the heavy-handed stuff.
1923	And they told us that too.
1924	And they try to get someone who’s a new face and fresh and awfully eager to get awfully rich like Blair did.
1925	And they use millions of dollars to hire marketers on Madison Avenue to brainwash us into the good work that they're doing.
1926	And they’ve been at it ever since.
1927	And they’ve done it, they’ve pretty well done it, in our lifetimes, they’ve taken over the food and the water, quietly, by stealth, through governments again just signing bills through and it’s all kept fairly quiet.
1928	And they've done that.
1929	And they’ve gone from link to link to link, and they’re absolutely mind-bombed with bits and bytes of data from UFOs to walking biped reptilians and this kind of stuff.
1930	And they’ve moved on from there.
1931	And they want you in, so that you’ll die off over the next, up to 2050, and then the population is to just drastically drop, apparently, according to all their studies.
1932	And they were awfully successful about it.
1933	And they were letting the drugs in.
1934	And they will adapt very quickly to the new system of total security, total observation, no bodily rights even, to go unmolested anywhere.
1935	And they will use anything.
1936	And they wonder, they wonder why these countries turn against Americans.
1937	And they wouldn’t have the problem of male and female interaction and grief, etc.
1938	And this analysis of the Financial Times should painfully show that in the worst case scenario (break up of the EU) where Bulgaria would stand.
1939	And this comes from a number of reasons such as their non-europian friendly think.
1940	And this European Single Market can only function properly if it has the adequate infrastructure, provided by SGIs providers, being either public or private, authorities or operators” expressed Valeria RONZITTI, CEEP General Secretary.
1941	And this flexible approach has already taken us on an incredible journey.
1942	And this grey area is dangerous for these people.

1975	And we’ll go to the telephones, and there’s Noah from Washington on the line, Washington DC.
1976	And we observe that this convergence of interests has put in motion a process of progressive attenuation of power politics, and the beginning of a policy of world unification.
1977	And we pretend that they are too.
1978	And we’re not too worried about or even think about that.
1979	And we're really pretty well here.
1980	And we should be able to make these changes too.
1981	And we sit back and accept it.
1982	And we stand ready to help and support in any way we can.
1983	And we’ve got to understand that, switch off, start studying and then start learning.

1998	And when they gave the pocket money to their children and support for their children in this middle-class, they didn’t become all lazy, they developed themselves.
1999	And when Tony Blair was in, he wrote to this mentor and he asked is it possible to combine that type of freedom with positive freedom.
2000	And when you cross a Chicago thug like Obama,…" Alan: And I would say the guys behind him were the bigger thugs in Chicago.
2001	And when youngsters don’t have dads they’re fair game for anybody to come along, either perverts or gang leaders or whatever it happens to be, that’s going to take them under their wing and say, I’ll protect you, or, I’ll show you the ropes.

2012	And yet alcohol is still legal, while cannabis isn’t.
2013	And yet it is not impossible to obtain resources adequate to face the challenges that threaten mankind.
2014	And yet which means that really, yeah they had already discovered all this stuff a long time ago because you wouldn’t need a mathematician unless you had actually discovered where they are and so on and could use a mathematician in the process.
2015	Andy managed to map hip hop snare samples pads to work as a MIDI controller for GarageBand on his Mac.

19118	That’s all part of the big plan.
19119	That's all to appeal to the ego.

19135	That's how a predator talks, and how he acts.
19136	That's how far they've gone with things.

19143	That’s how long it took Joris Luyendijk to map out the financial sector.
19144	That's how seriously they've been treating it up until now, they've been sending everyone home or telling them to 'stay at home and have a couple of days rest'.
19145	That's how, that's really what education is about.
19146	That’s how they speak up there, undignified.

19148	That’s how they work.
19149	That’s how this whole network runs.
19150	That's how we've been brainwashed.
19151	That's how you create it.
19152	That’s how you get rich, isn’t it?

19157	That’s just one of the benefits ACN customers can now enjoy with the launch of the company’s competitively positioned line rental service in the Netherlands.
19158	That's kind of like the feeling you get when you have one of those days.
19159	That’s my opinion on it.
19160	That's no joke.
19161	That’s not a middle-class problem in my view, but a problem concerning the emergence of a new underclass.
19162	That’s okay… and they’re going along with it; these FOOLS are going along with it.
19163	That’s okay that stuff.
19164	That's part of The Council on Foreign Relations.
19165	That’s part of the technique that they’re using.
19166	That’s probably the reason.
19167	That's psychic driving – psychic trauma, which is intentional, because to get a war going that you've planned for years you've got to make the igniting incident overwhelm the viewers, to get them emotionally involved.
19168	That’s really how it’s laid out and we just go through the motions as all the changes affect us.
19169	That’s really the reason they gave it to the public and to be honest with you, people have asked me as well, even mainstream shows I’ve been on, ‘does the computer and the internet really help people in their understanding?’
19170	That’s the agenda right now.
19171	That’s the dream of Frederic Jacobs (@FredericJacobs), a member of the coder community Open Whisper, who has just created a new version of Signal, an app so simple that anyone can use it without paying attention to the complex cryptography behind it.

19173	That's the House of Ash.
19174	That's their attitude today.
19175	That's their own words, that would fit the bill.
19176	That’s their planned society, the way they think it should be run, you see, properly.
19177	That's their real job, is to tell politicians what to do.
19178	That’s the oldest trick in the book, they’ve got to make things really happen.
19179	That’s the only thing you heard about in the 80’s in Britain and across Europe and in the U.S., Canada, and so on, lots of porn in it, even if you didn’t have a computer they kept telling you every day there is lots of porn there.
19180	That's the reality and they use double-speak all the time to get their way.
19181	That's the reality of it; and one day, one day probably not to far away, we'll wake up to a few shocks as they bring on chaos – because their motto is ORDO AB CHAO.

19187	That's the start of it; they always give low numbers to start with, that's low, these days.
19188	That's the thing you see.
19189	That’s the type they’ve been employing, very deliberately.
19190	That’s the way it happens.
19191	That’s the way people make their money.
19192	That’s the wonderful system we’re in now.
19193	That’s they key to it.
19194	That’s wars that are going to create a massive backlash for generations from people who lose their homes, lose their businesses, lose their relatives.
19195	That’s what brought the countries of the West out of the Great Depression, manufacturing for a world war.
19196	That’s what happened in Europe.
19197	That’s what I’m saying; you’re always used at the bottom, you know, you’re always used at the bottom.
19198	That’s what it basically means.
19199	That’s what it’s about, with Facebook, etc.

19215	That's what they're looking towards in a step-by-step process, and ultimately using the material which is mankind themselves and creating new humans for specially designed purposes.
19216	That’s what they’re now making you use for your chicken feed here in Canada and the States.) But anyway, they’re all crooks at the top, and it’s just pure propaganda.
19217	That’s what they say about people who are brainwashed, they don’t know they have been.
19218	That’s what they say at the top.
19219	That's what they teach the next medical bunch coming out of universities; it’s the new normal.
19220	That’s what they think freedom is.
19221	That’s what they were set up to do, under the United Nations.
19222	“That’s what we have been waiting so long for, what millions of Ukrainians wanted to achieve and what they’ve been fighting for over the last six months.

19225	That’s where all the important artists worked, and where the money was.

19227	That's why Australia is leading the charge for this depopulation idea.
19228	That’s why Centric guarantees the migration and integration of heterogeneous hardware and software systems.

19230	That’s why he wrote… These guys don’t make guesses and so on.

19232	That's why the Liberals should strengthen their efforts to promote a better understanding of liberal policies.
19233	That’s why the Rolling Stones get knighted.
19234	That’s why the same agenda goes forth across the whole world, into every nation; I’ll be touching on some of that tonight.
19235	That’s why they are rushing ahead with all these social changes and lies, blatant lies.
19236	That’s why they bred a generation to be the way that they are.

19238	That’s why they get IN on each other’s scams.
19239	That’s why they launched psychiatry, if you didn’t know the history of it.
19240	That’s why they’ll turn on you.

19244	That's why they've got to be there so long in Iraq and elsewhere.
19245	That’s why we dream big.
19246	That´s why we must be fully aware of this opponent.
19247	Thats why we need to think about development of security tests and certification of middleware for provisioning security cloud solution.
19248	That’s why with Michael Mann and the Strategic Communications Division, we have been working, since the very..

19251	That's why you call it the mass.
19252	That's why you call yourself sheep in churches; and a sheep is the stupidest animal you could ever meet.

19275	That was when the America war plane was directly overhead and the brave camera man who lost his life and you saw the plane nose down directly over the building that they guy was filming off of.

19278	That week is most of the time when you are most fertile.
